<h2>{% trans "Call for Submissions" %}</h2>

<p>{% trans "SciPyLA 2016, the forth annual Scientific Computing with Python in Latin America conference, will be held this May 16th-20th in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. SciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPyLA Conference allows participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development." %}</p>

<p>{% trans "The conference will kick off with two days of tutorials. These sessions provide extremely affordable access to expert training, and consistently receive fantastic feedback from participants.  " %}</p>

<p>{% trans "<strong>We are now accepting tutorial proposals from individuals or teams that would like to teach a tutorial at SciPyLA 2016</strong>" %}</p>

<p>{% trans "Whether you are a major contributor to a scientific Python library or an expert-level user, this is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and offset some of the costs of your SciPyLA 2016 attendance." %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "Topics" %}</h3>

<p>{% trans "Tutorials should be focused on covering a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner.  We want to see attendees coding! We encourage submissions to be designed to allow at least 50% of the time for hands-on exercises even if this means the subject matter needs to be limited." %}</p>


<p>{% trans "For examples of content and format, you can refer to past tutorials from SciPy tutorial sessions (<a href='http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2015/participate/tutorials/' target='_blank'>SciPy2015</a>, <a href='http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/participate/tutorials/' target='_blank'>SciPy2014</a>).  We are looking for awesome techniques or packages, helping new or advanced python programmers develop better or faster scientific applications." %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "Proposal Submission" %}</h3>

<p>{% trans "To submit a proposal, <a href='https://conference.scipy.org/scipyla2016/account/signup/'>sign up</a> or <a href='https://conference.scipy.org/scipyla2016/account/login/'>log in</a> to your account and proceed to your <a href='https://conference.scipy.org/scipyla2016/dashboard/'>account dashboard</a>." %}</p>

    <li>{% trans "A description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy website for attendees to view. It should include the target audience, the expected level of knowledge prior to the class, and the goals of the class." %}</li>
    <li>{% trans "A more detailed outline of the tutorial content including the duration of each part and exercise sessions. Please include a description of how you plan to make the tutorial hands-on." %}</li>
    <li>{% trans "A list of Python packages that attendees will need to have installed prior to the class to follow along. Please mention if any packages are not cross platform. Installation instructions or links to installation documentation should be provided for packages that are not available through easy_install, pip, EPD, Anaconda, etc., or that require third party or compiled libraries." %}</li>
