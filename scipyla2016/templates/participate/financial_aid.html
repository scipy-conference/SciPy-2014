SciPyLA 2016 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend the conference. These sponsorships can provide funding for airfare, lodging, and conference registration. Like last year, these sponsorships will be open to community members and students.

<p>{% trans "
Applications will be judged both on merit as well as need. Although all attendees are eligible for sponsorships, we encourage applicants to consider their level of need before applying, such as whether their institution is covering some or all of their travel costs. As funds are limited, our goal is to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible. If only partial sponsorship is required, please indicate this in the application and we may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable requests." %}

Applications are no longer being accepted for SciPyLA 2016. The recipients will be announced on May 5th, 2014." %}
