SciPy Latin America is a regional community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source software for mathematics, science, and engineering mainly developed with Python." %}</p>

<p>{% trans "During the conference SciPyLA is proud to host the following event and talk types:" %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Talks" %}</h2>

<p>{% trans "These are the traditional lectures. They have a maximum duration of 30 minutes with 5 minutes for questions. If you believe you have a topic but do not know how to write the proposal, contact our activities committee and we will help you in this task. We will gladly help you submit a good proposal." %}

<h2>{% trans "Posters" %}</h2>

<p>{% trans "The teen track is a journey that aims to introduce a great creative potential public (such as children and adolescents) the world of science, programming and any area that can contribute to your creative, through an educational and fun interactive way ." %}
</p>

<p>{% trans "One of the goals of this conference is to show teenagers that science and programming are made by people like them. Both are present in daily use by anyone and the only thing needed is the desire to learn and implement these ideas that arise in their minds. And it can become generators of ideas that can be useful to others." %}
