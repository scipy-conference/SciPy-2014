                Since 1960, the Federal University of  Santa Catarina (UFSC) has
                been participating in the economic, social, political and
                cultural development of the State and of the country. Throughout
                this period it has been working on preparing students to become
                highly skilled professionals, thus contributing to scientific
                progress and establishing itself as a niche of excellence, and
                being ranked as one of the best centers for higher education in
                Brazil.
                </p>
                <p>
                Today, besides the investments made on new facilities and on
                increasing the offers for admission and the range of programs
                offered at the campus of Florianópolis, UFSC can already see
                results of its expansion in the state through the campi of
                Joinville, Curitibanos and Araranguá, where the focus is on
                meeting the local and regional needs and  demands.
